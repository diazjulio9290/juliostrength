    q: "Do I need a gym?",
    a: "Yes, you need access to a gym. I design programs around barbells, machines, and cables to drive steady progress. If you’re new to the gym, I’ll guide you on setup, safety, and how to use the equipment confidently.",

    q: "Is this beginner friendly?",
    a: "Absolutely. We start at your level, lock in great form, and progress week by week so you see results without feeling overwhelmed. Each workout includes clear instructions and simple progressions so you always know what to do next.",

    q: "How do payments work?",
