        <p className="text-sm text-neutral-400">Last updated: December 30, 2025</p>

        <p>

          these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old to purchase coaching services. By purchasing, you confirm you meet this
          requirement.

        <h2>Coaching Scope (Not Medical Care)</h2>
        <p>
          Coaching provides general fitness and nutrition guidance for education and performance purposes only. This is
          not medical care.
        </p>

        <p>
          Julio is not a certified personal trainer (CPT), licensed physician, registered dietitian (RD/RDN), physical
          therapist, or medical professional. Coaching is based on personal experience and self-education, not formal
          certification. We do not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Always consult a qualified physician before starting or changing any exercise or nutrition program, especially
          if you have any pre-existing medical conditions, injuries, or health concerns.
        </p>

          <li>
